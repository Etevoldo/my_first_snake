This is a little snake game I made as an selfproposed exercise to use everything i've learnt from C and Git

# Build instructions 

`gcc main.c snake.c engine.c fruit.c -o snake`

# Future plans

- put some datastructure of some sort (probably a queue as the snake's tail).
- add makefiles.
- better organization of header files.
- check portability.
